# CPSC 210 Project

## *Digital Recipe Book*

This project is envisioned as a robust digital platform designed to cater specifically to 
home cooks and culinary students. The core functionality of this application will revolve around creating,
editing and removing recipes, making it a centralized hub for food enthusiasts.

Users will have the ability to meticulously manage their recipes, ensuring easy access and 
organization of their culinary creations. The project will address a common issue faced by individuals 
who, like myself, have embarked on culinary journeys and often find themselves struggling to recall 
cooking instructions for various dishes. With this digital recipe book, users will be able to maintain 
a well-organized and accessible collection of their favorite recipes, effectively eliminating the 
frustration of forgetting crucial cooking steps.
